Points: 95/100

General remarks:
- In the solve() function, you allocate the array `unew`, but you do not deallocate it.
- You declare the loop variables i and j, declare them as private, and then redeclare them in the loop header.

[x] Working finite difference discretization of Poisson's problem (10 pts.)
[x] Working implementation of at least one solver (10 pts.)
[x] Code uses OpenMP for parallelism (10 pts.)
[x] Parallel code is correct and free of race conditions (10 pts.)
[x] Discussion of OpenMP directives and their use (15 pts.)
[x] Discussion of code verification (15 pts.)
[x] Plots of measured parallel performance and speedups (20 pts.)
    - Please plot speedups, not only elapsed time. (-5 pts.)
[x] Discussion of performance results (10 pts.)
    - The limiting factor in shared memory parallelism is not really communication. It is more about the overhead of managing the threads, assigning work, and getting data to the CPU fast enough to keep all threads busy.
