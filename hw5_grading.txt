Points: 97/100

General remarks:

[x] Correct finite difference discretization of Poisson's problem (5 pts.)
[x] Correct algorithm for Jacobi solver (5 pts.)
[x] Working OpenCL implementation (20 pts.)
    - It is not necessary to set the kernel arguments each time you queue the kernel.
[x] Verification of OpenCL code based on errors (10 pts.)
    - Please consider presenting results like this in a table.
[x] Comparison of errors to serial code (10 pts.)
[x] Comparison of errors to GPU code (10 pts.)
[x] Runtimes for OpenCL code (10 pts.)
    - Please improve the presentation of the results.
      It is very hard to read and compare the times when they are not presented in a table.
      Also, some of the units are incorrect (seconds instead of microseconds).
      (-3 pts.)
[x] Runtimes for CPU code (10 pts.)
[x] Runtimes for GPU code (10 pts.)
[x] Discussion of results (10 pts.)
