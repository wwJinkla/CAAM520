The computation of Throughput (GFLOPS/s) in my report is wrong. Instead of dividing the flop_count_sp by the average run time of one call to a CUDA kernel, I divided it by the total run time. This leads to a much lower Throughput. Since it already passed the homework deadline, I will modify my report after the grade is given.
