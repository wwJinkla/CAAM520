The computation of Throughput (GFLOPS/s) in my report is wrong. Instead of dividing the flop_count_sp by the average run time of one call to a CUDA kernel, I divided it by the total run time. This leads to a much lower Throughput (~ x1e-4 smaller). Since it already passed the homework deadline, I will modify my report after the grade is given.   

I also added some doc strings to hw04.cu on April 23, with no substantial changes.
